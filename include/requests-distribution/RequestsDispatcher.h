/*
* RequestsDispatcher class is designed to manage requests

* responsible for a particular service. Class fiddles with
* ClientRequest objects (@see ClientRequests.hpp) to determin
* what kind of action is required.
*
* IMPORTANT:
*
* Requests management does not take into account visual aspects
* of the application (except settings management). It's purely
* semantic module responsible for application's logic.
